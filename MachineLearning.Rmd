### How do you frame your main question as a machine learning problem?
Will employees quit or stay?
It is a supervised problem, we use logistic regression model, classification and regression trees and a random forest model. 

### What are the main features you will use?
We will use all the independent variables from the data frame. IF they are not significant in the logistic regression model then will remove the predictors. 

### Which machine learning technique will you use?
logistic regression model, classification and regression trees and a random forest model. 

### How will you evaluate the sucess of  your machine learning technique?
we will use confusionmatrix to see the accuracy of the model, then we will use ROC and precision and recall plots to see how well the model performs.
